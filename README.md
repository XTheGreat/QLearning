# QLearning
Consider a simplified version of the arcade game Pac-Man.  An agent moves on an open grid with randomly-placed pellets, and a ghost periodically moves across the grid. The agent receives large negative rewards (and loses the game) for touching a wall or the ghost. It receives smaller positive rewards for touching (and thus consuming) pellets.

To run on linux: python qlearn.py
